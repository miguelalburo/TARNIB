# TARNIB's Predictive Modeling for Clinical Outcomes

Hi 👋,

We are the *Team for Advanced Research in Neural Inference for Biostatistics* a.k.a **TARNIB**, a group of postgraduate bioinformatics students at the University of Birmingham. Our project focuses on building and comparing ML to predict patient in-hospital mortality risk and length of stay using synthetic clinical data inspired by the [MIMIC-III/IV datasets](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/). We also aim to investigate whether ethnic group impacts model performance.
